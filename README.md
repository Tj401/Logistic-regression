What Is My Purpose?

A. To predict the age range and class of the people who survived the titanic diaster.

How Did I Do This?

A. I have gathered the Titanic data online. Here my target variable is the AGE and input variables are the sex, class and survived. After converting the the data to pandas dataframe, I have performed EDA and tried to remove the columns which doesnt account for the output.
Then I have coverted sone categorical data like sex, class into dummy variables to proceed further. Then I have tried to split the data and fed into the model. As we know that the logistic regression shall output the probabilities of the output rather than the ouptut itself.
